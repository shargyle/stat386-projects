I first became interested in statistics and data science because of my love for basketball. In the NBA, data is ubiquitous, and it's becoming more influential in managers' and coaches' decision making. Each basketball game has a resulting "box score", a table displaying descriptive numbers about the game at a team and player level (e.g. points scored, field goals made, rebounds, time played). Over the course of a season, a player's performance can be measured and tracked through the aggregation of these box scores. [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/) stores this insightful data for each player that has ever played in the NBA.

I'll explain how to scrape this data from the web by doing the following:
- discussing unique obstacles presented by the website strucutre and how to overcome these issues.
- dispalying code that scrapes the data and organizes it into a `pandas` dataframe.
