# About Me
Hey everyone! I'm a statistics student at BYU, set to graduate in April 2023. I love data science--learning about the world through data and by using skills taught in the disciplines statistics, mathematics, and computer science.
My goal is to become a data scientist--one who discovers truth that enables inspired decisions.
